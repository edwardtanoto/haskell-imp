# haskell-imp

In this assignment you will implement the Haskell Imp game in Haskell.

**Rules of Play**

 An Imp lives on a rectangular grid and each turn can move north (N), east (E), south (S) or west (W).
 The Imp starts with finite fuel and each turn uses 1 unit of fuel to move.
 The Imp is not able to move through walls, out of the grid or back to a position it has already visited.
 The Imp’s goal is to get from the start position to the end position, collecting as many jewels as
possible on the way, before running out of fuel.
 If all the fuel is used up before reaching the end, the Imp dies and end of game!
